width 3 ; original pooter assembly language.
address 1 
    ; technically, the ISA can support larger addresses, but can only jump between the lowest 3 bits.
    ; although it basically sucks and can't do anything anyways, so a bit of a moot point.

; symbols are very simple, and don't care about the syntax that surrounds them.
symbol NOP 0        ; pootasm can support decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal literals.
symbol STP 0x1      ; halt execution.
symbol INA 0b10     ; Whole input thing, user input -> A
symbol STA 0o3      ; Argument: value to store in the A register.
symbol SWP 0o4      ; swap A and B.
symbol JNZ 0b101    ; Argument: lowest 3 bits of the address to jump to.
symbol ADD 0o6      ; A+B -> A
symbol SUB 0b111    ; A-B -> A (I think, could be other way around? Not clear.)
